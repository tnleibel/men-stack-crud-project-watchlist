# WatchList

## INTRO
I love movies, so I made a neat little CRUD app so you can create a watchlist of movies! When you first access the website, you won't be able to do much without an account, so go ahead and create one then! Once that's done, you can either head to your own watchlist and start filling it with movies (seen or unseen), or you can check out the users page to see other people's watchlists if you need some inspiration. To create a new movie, simply click the link on your watchlist page and fill out the form with the required details as well as any additional information you'd like to add. Once the movie is created, click through to its page from your watchlist and you can use the poster picker to add a poster for your movie! Don't worry, the API will automatically search the name of the movie, so you won't have to do much looking around.

When you want to get started, head over to the [website!](https://men-stack-project-watchlist-13a22de077a0.herokuapp.com/)
Additionally, my planning materials can be found[here!](https://trello.com/b/npL2C8Qm/men-stack-project-proposal)

## ATTRIBUTIONS
A big part of this project, the ability to add posters, is only possible because of [The Movie Database](themoviedb.org), who graciously granted me an API key and allowed me to use their search API to find posters.

## TECHNOLOGIES
This project was achieved using Javascript, HTML, and CSS for basic site layout and controllers, and MongoDB, Express, and Node.js for backend operations and routing.

## NEXT STEPS
In the short term, I would like to add session functionality, so that the user does not get logged out every time they close the page or the server restarts. Longer term, I would be nterested in eventually changing the functionality of the website so that users can simply search for a movie using the TMDB API and add that movie to their watchlist that way, rather than having to fill out a form for each movie.
